# Contributing to this project
Welcome, and thanks for your intrest in contributing to the project. Below are a few guidelines to help you contribute in a productive way. These are guidelines, not strict rules. If in doubt, use common sense and feel free to suggests changes to these guidelines via a pull request.

## Reporting bugs

## Addressing open issues
The issue tracker contains a collection of issues that are waiting for someone to handle them. A number of
labels are used to categorise these:

|  Label           |    Description |
| -------          |  --------------- |
| `bug`            |  Something is broken and should be fixed sooner rather than later. |
| `enhancement`    |  A new feature or substantial improvement to the algorithm. |
| `infrastructure` |  Tasks related to the general infrastructure of the project. These don't require any changes to the underlying algorithm. |
| `investigate`    |  Issues that may require some digging into the data and the output the algorithm generates from it to decide whether a change to the algorithm is required. This may result in a request for a new feature, a tweak to the algorithm or a bug report, rather than any code being contributed directly. |
| `question`       | Requests for clarification or discussion that aren't feature requests or bug reports. |
| `tweak`          |  A minor change to the algorithm or its implementation. |
